The programme goes through the waypoints backwards, aka starting from the last waypoint (the theoretical goal point). At each waypoint, it checks its distance from 
the goal point and compares it to the previous waypoint's distance from the goal point. Once it finds a waypoint, which is at a greater distance from the goal point
than the previous one, then it has found that the previous waypoint was the one closest to the goal point. All waypoints at larger indexes than the found waypoint are 
removed and the goal point is updated to match the x an y coordinates of the found waypoint.
